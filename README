# Hoe Jun Leong Submission

Main code is process_img.py

I've explored various morphology and thresholding methods, along with semi-light preprocessing methods
as well.

Apologies for not completing the task due to time constraints on my end, but nonetheless it was
extremely fun and rewarding to practice!

One thing i wanted to try but didn't have time to implement is gray world's algo. There's likely 
more but yea this is supposed to be a short exercise after all haha
